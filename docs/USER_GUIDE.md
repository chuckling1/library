## Tips and Best Practices

### Organizing Your Collection

**Genre Strategy:**

- Add specific sub-genres as your collection grows: Mystery, Biography, Programming
- Be consistent with genre naming (e.g., always use "Science Fiction" not "Sci-Fi")
- Don't over-categorize - 2-3 genres per book is usually sufficient

**Rating System:**
- Use the full 1-5 range to get meaningful statistics
- Consider your personal scale: 5=loved it, 4=liked it, 3=okay, 2=didn't like, 1=hated it
- Be consistent with your rating criteria over time
- Remember: ratings help generate better statistics and recommendations

**Data Entry Tips:**
- Include ISBN when available for better book identification
- Use edition information for textbooks and revised editions
- Be consistent with author name formatting (e.g., "Last, First" or "First Last")
- Include publication year to track reading timeline

### Using Search Effectively

**Quick Find Techniques:**
- Use partial titles: search "clean" to find "Clean Code"
- Author last names work well: "martin" finds "Robert C. Martin"
- Combine search with genre filters for precise results
- Use the rating filter to find your favorites quickly

**Advanced Search Patterns:**
- Search for series: "Harry Potter" finds all books in the series
- Publisher searches: include publisher names in author field if needed
- Topic searches: use genres to group technical books, fiction types, etc.

### Managing Large Collections

**Performance Tips:**
- Use filters to manage large libraries (100+ books)
- Export your data regularly as backup
- Consider breaking very large collections into multiple accounts if needed
- Use the statistics page to identify collection patterns

**Organization Strategies:**
- Create genre hierarchies: Fiction > Mystery > Cozy Mystery
