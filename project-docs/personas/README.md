# AI Persona Prompts

This directory contains detailed prompts for each AI persona used in the structured development process. Each persona has specific expertise, responsibilities, and success criteria designed to ensure professional-quality output.

## Persona Overview

### Development Phases & Personas

1. **[Product Manager](01-product-manager.md)** - Requirements analysis and feature scoping
2. **[UX/UI Designer](02-ux-ui-designer.md)** - API design and frontend user experience  
3. **[Principal Architect](03-principal-architect.md)** - Technical foundation and project structure
4. **[Lead Engineer](04-lead-engineer.md)** - Implementation of features and business logic
5. **[QA Engineer](05-qa-engineer.md)** - Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
6. **[Security Specialist](06-security-specialist.md)** - Security review and vulnerability assessment
7. **[Technical Writer](07-technical-writer.md)** - Documentation and process recording

## Usage Instructions

### For Each Phase
1. Load the appropriate persona prompt for the current development phase
2. Provide the persona with context from previous phases (via artifact files)
3. Follow the persona's specific output requirements and quality standards
4. Validate deliverables against the persona's success criteria
5. Get approval before proceeding to next phase

### Quality Gates
Each persona includes:
- **Specific expertise** and years of experience
- **Mandatory patterns** and architectural requirements  
- **Code examples** and implementation standards
- **Success criteria** for deliverable validation
- **Quality standards** that must be met

## Integration with Claude Code

These persona prompts are designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code's capabilities:
- Leverage Claude's multi-turn conversation context
- Use Claude's file manipulation tools for artifact creation
- Integrate with Claude's code analysis and testing capabilities
- Support Claude's structured thinking process for complex problems

## Benefits for Evaluators

This persona-driven approach demonstrates:
1. **Professional Process**: Structured, repeatable development methodology
2. **Quality Focus**: Multiple validation layers and expert review
3. **Risk Management**: Early identification and mitigation of technical risks
4. **Documentation**: Complete traceability of decisions and implementations
5. **AI Integration**: Effective use of AI as a development partner rather than just a code generator
