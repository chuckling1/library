# Product Plan: Book Library Application

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
The Book Library Application is a full-stack take-home challenge designed to demonstrate professional development capabilities through a structured AI-assisted workflow. This project showcases both technical competency and modern development practices using C# .NET Core Web API with a React frontend.

### Business Objectives
- **Primary**: Create a functional book management system with CRUD operations and basic analytics
- **Secondary**: Demonstrate structured AI-assisted development methodology
- **Tertiary**: Showcase professional code quality, testing, and deployment practices

### Key Success Metrics
- **Feature Completeness (30%)**: All core CRUD operations and stats endpoint functional
- **Code Quality (25%)**: Clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing
- **API Design (20%)**: RESTful design, proper HTTP status codes, OpenAPI documentation
- **Frontend UX (15%)**: Intuitive user interface, proper state management, error handling
- **Error Handling (10%)**: Robust validation, graceful degradation, user feedback

### Technical Complexity Assessment
**Overall Complexity: Medium (M)**
- **Backend**: Medium - Standard CRUD with EF Core, relatively straightforward
- **Frontend**: Medium - React with state management, API integration, charting
- **Integration**: Low - Standard REST API consumption
- **Deployment**: Medium - Multi-service coordination with database

### Timeline and Risk Considerations
- **Estimated Timeline**: 12-16 hours of development across 4-5 phases
- **Key Risks**: 
  - Feature creep from bonus requirements
  - Over-engineering due to professional showcase requirements
  - Integration complexity between frontend and backend validation
- **Mitigation**: Phase-gate validation, MVP-first approach, automated validation gates

## Clarifying Questions

### Technical Decisions Requiring Input
1. **Authentication Scope**: Should we implement the JWT bonus feature as part of the core MVP, or keep it strictly as a bonus?
   - **Recommendation**: Keep as bonus to maintain scope control

2. **Data Validation Strategy**: Should validation be primarily client-side, server-side, or both?
   - **Recommendation**: Both, with server-side as authoritative

3. **Chart Library Selection**: Any preference for visualization library (Chart.js, Recharts, D3)?
   - **Recommendation**: Recharts (better AI example availability, React-native)

4. **Deployment Priority**: Is containerization/cloud deployment essential for evaluation, or can we focus on local development excellence?
   - **Recommendation**: Focus on code quality first, containerization as bonus

### Clarified Requirements (Stakeholder Input Received)
1. **Book Uniqueness**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Allow duplicate titles/authors with version/edition support. Consider ISBN or edition field for reprints.
2. **Rating System**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Integer input (1-5) for user ratings, display fractional averages when multiple ratings exist.
3. **Genre Management**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Hybrid tag system with predefined base genres + user-created custom genres.
4. **Date Handling**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Date-only format (no time component) for PublishedDate.

### Updated Data Model Specification

```json
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer",
  "author": "Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas",

}
```

### Implementation Details for Clarified Requirements

**Genre System Architecture**:
- Predefined base genres: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science, Technology, Biography, History, etc.
- User-created custom genres stored and validated
- Many-to-many relationship: Book ↔ Genre
- Autocomplete UI with existing genre suggestions
- Genre popularity/usage statistics

**Rating System Implementation**:
- User input: Integer selection 1-5 (star rating UI)
- Database storage: Individual ratings per book
- Display: Calculated average as decimal (e.g., 4.2/5)
- Statistics: Genre-based average ratings

**Edition/Version Support**:
- Optional ISBN field for unique identification
- Edition/version text field for reprints
- Allow multiple entries of same title/author with different editions
- Search and display considerations for book variants

### Assumptions Requiring Validation
1. **Single User Scope**: Assuming single-user system unless JWT authentication is implemented
2. **SQLite for Simplicity**: Assuming SQLite is preferred for easy setup and evaluation
3. **Modern Browser Support**: Targeting current browser versions (last 2 major releases)
4. **Development Environment**: Assuming .NET 8+ and Node.js 18+ availability

### Integration and Deployment Considerations
1. **CORS Configuration**: Will frontend and backend run on different ports during development?
2. **Database Migration Strategy**: Should migrations be applied automatically on startup or manually?
3. **Environment Configuration**: How should connection strings and API URLs be managed across environments?
4. **Testing Data**: Should the system include seed data for demonstration purposes?
