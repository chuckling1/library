## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-03

### Added
- Initial repository setup with .gitignore and README
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with strict development standards
- SYSTEM_PROMPT.md for context restoration
- Project directory structure (backend/, frontend/, project-docs/)
- Development workflow and coding standards documentation

### Standards Established
- Interface-based architecture with no abstract classes
- Strict TypeScript and C# typing (no any/object/dynamic)
- Repository pattern with dependency injection
- Structured JSON logging format
- 80% test coverage requirement
- xUnit (backend) and Vitest (frontend) testing frameworks

### AI Development Process
- Created 7 detailed persona prompts for structured AI-assisted development
- Each persona has specific expertise, deliverables, and success criteria
- Personas cover: Product Manager, UX/UI Designer, Principal Architect, Lead Engineer, QA Engineer, Security Specialist, Technical Writer
- Process designed to showcase professional AI integration methodology
- Quality gates established for phase validation and approval

### Technical Refinements (Post Quality Review)
- Finalized project naming: LibraryApi solution and project structure
- Added strict StyleCop configuration with treat warnings as errors
- Implemented OpenAPI-first approach for type-safe frontend-backend contracts
- Added Entity Framework best practices (AsNoTracking, async patterns, CancellationToken)
- Configured ultra-strict TypeScript settings (noImplicitAny, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, etc.)
- Specified Moq for .NET unit testing, focus on unit tests over integration tests
- Selected Recharts for data visualization (best AI example availability)
- Updated persona prompts to reflect contract-first development approach

### Mandatory Validation Gates Implementation
- Added comprehensive 5-step validation sequence (lint, build, test, performance, security)
- Created detailed validation checklist with 100% pass requirement
- Implemented zero-tolerance policy: ANY failure = STOP development
- Added performance evaluation criteria (async patterns, bundle size, React.memo)
- Added security evaluation criteria (no hardcoded secrets, input validation, XSS prevention)
- Updated Lead Engineer persona with mandatory validation workflow
- Created project-docs/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md for systematic validation tracking

### Validation Script Automation
- Created automated backend validation script (PowerShell): backend/validate.ps1
- Created automated frontend validation script (Node.js): frontend/validate.js
- Implemented parallel execution where possible for faster validation cycles
- Added comprehensive static analysis for performance and security issues
- Scripts provide detailed reporting with color-coded success/failure indicators
- Single command execution reduces Claude Code tool calls significantly
- Added --skip-tests and --verbose options for development workflow flexibility
